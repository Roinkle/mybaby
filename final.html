        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">It's our first Valentine’s Day, and I know we don’t really care about it much. But even so, I wanted to do something just a little something for us.</p>

        <p><strong> Happy Valentine’s Day, baby</strong></p>   
            
        <p>   I love you in ways I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fully express. I want you in forms so deep and vast that even the forms themselves would be confused. I need you like the very breath in me, one that doesn’t even realize how much it craves something as special as you.
            
            Every single day, every minute, and every second since I’ve known you has been nothing short of amazing. You are everything I’ve ever wanted. I love our chats, I love being playful and teasing you, and I even love the way we get mad at each other. I love loving you.
            
            And man, when you say, “You are my everything,” something inside me feels complete like I’ve finally heard the words I’ve been longing for all my life.
            
            I won’t say I’m perfect, but every day, I feel like I want to be better in some way something I haven’t figured out yet, but I know I will. And when I do, it’ll be for you.
            
            I love you, my jaan. This isn’t just something to read it’s the truth of my heart and you know it is what it is.
        </p>
        <p>I don’t know if you remember me saying that I’ve started writing our wedding vows, and you told me that you’d just speak from your heart when the time comes. So, I guess I’m doing the same now and sharing what I’ve written for you.</p>
        <p>The person you are, and have always been, is truly incredible. I’ve never met anyone like you, and I know that even if I searched the world, I never would.

            The way you understand, the way you do things, it's just amazing. Your smile, your perfectly imperfect sense of humor, your laughter, and even your adorable attempts at not being so innocent, all of it makes you uniquely wonderful.
            
            Thank you for stepping into my life, my gorgeous, sexy, and irresistibly hot handsome lady.</p>
            
         <p>The world shifts when you walk by.
            Time stands still at the sound of your voice.
            The wind dances in color, and the rain falls in reverence to you.
            
            You are a masterpiece, carefully crafted by the universe—
            The one and only, a rare kind of magic.</p>
            
        <p>And everytime I think of you I have this music going in background, 
            "Haye haye mirchi uh uh mirchi
            Uf uf mirchi, fuh fuh mirchi
            Haye haye mirchi"
        </p>
        <p>I don’t know if you remember me saying that I’ve started writing our wedding vows, and you told me that you’d just speak from your heart when the time comes. So, I guess I’m doing the same now and sharing what I’ve written for you.</p>
        <p>
          You are blood of my blood and bone of my bone. <br>
         I give you my body, that we two may be one. <br>
         I give you my spirit, till our life shall be true. <br>
         In friendship, in love, and in endless longing, <br>
        I will stand by your side, hand in hand, forever to hold. 
        </p>

        <p>And one more thing—my parents gave me the world.<br>  
        But your parents gave me <strong>MY WORLD</strong>.</p>

        <p>I love you, wifey ❤️</p>
